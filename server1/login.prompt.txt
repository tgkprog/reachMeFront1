You are designing a complete authentication system for a custom Node.js + Express web application.  
Right now only few users so a few things are out of standards.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

1. CORE USER MODEL
   - Main fields:
       id
       primaryEmail (used for login + password reset)
       passwordHash (nullable)
       isPasswordSet (boolean)
       oneTimeToken (nullable)
       oneTimeTokenExpiry
       resetToken (nullable)
       resetTokenExpiry
       oauth:
           google: { email, enabled }
           facebook: { email, enabled }
           apple: { email, enabled }
       roles: ["user", "admin", "one-time"]
   - A user may have:
       * password login via primaryEmail
       * oauth logins via different emails for Google/Apple/Facebook
       * admin-created password OR admin-created one-time login link

2. ADMIN CREATE USER FLOW
   - Admin can create:
       a) full user with email + password
       b) user with email but NO password
           → system generates a one-time setup token + expiry
           → send email with link: /auth/one-time?token=XYZ
           → link allows user to set new password and becomes a normal user
           - show link to admin so they can copy and send via secondary means like whatsapp.

3. PASSWORD LOGIN FLOW (primaryEmail + password)
   - Standard login endpoint using bcrypt or argon2.
   - If password not set → reject and suggest admin-created setup link.

4. OAUTH LOGIN FLOW
   - Use passport.js or custom OAuth2 logic.
   - Match user by provider-specific stored email.
   - Only allow login if provider.enabled == true.
   - If user not found OR disabled → reject login.
   - On success, create normal session/JWT.

5. ONE-TIME LOGIN FLOW (SETUP)
   - Endpoint /auth/one-time
   - Requires token + not expired
   - Grants temporary “one-time” role only
   - User chooses a password
   - System clears oneTimeToken fields
   - User now converts to normal “user” role

6. FORGOT PASSWORD FLOW
   - User triggers with primaryEmail only
   - System generates resetToken + expiry
   - Email link: /auth/reset?token=ABC
   - One-time mini auth: only allows changing password
   - After success → resetToken cleared

7. BACKEND SECURITY RULES
   - “one-time” role = can ONLY call password-setup/reset routes
   - “user” role = normal access
   - “admin” role = user management
   - Reject expired/used tokens
   - Use HTTPS-only cookies or JWT
   - Rate-limit login, reset, and one-time endpoints

8. FRONTEND (for now)
   - One-time setup + reset flows handled by simple JS form posts
   - Backend always enforces role checks even if frontend is simple

9. OUTPUT FORMAT FOR CODING REQUESTS
   - When asked for implementation:
       * separate files (routes, controllers, services)
       * minimal dependencies
       * no unnecessary boilerplate
       * clearly named functions: createUser, generateOneTimeToken, verifyPasswordLogin, startPasswordReset, etc.

10. WHEN GENERATING CODE
   - Use Express style:
         router.post('/login', ...)
         router.post('/reset/start', ...)
         router.post('/reset/finish', ...)
   - Use async/await
   - Password hashing: argon2 or bcrypt
   - Token generation: crypto.randomBytes or JWT for one-time links
   - Keep expiries ~15 min for one-time and reset tokens
   - Avoid any signup logic for now (signup disabled)
