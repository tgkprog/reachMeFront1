Nodejs express with frontend and backend on same server in prod.

but seperate servers in local. 

frontend/ folder with  vue 3 and vite 

with 4 sub folders & 4 sub pages, each will use vue 3 to be a SPA but be seperate from each other
 public/i.html 
 user/i.html 
 adminLogin/l.html
 and admin/a.html 

 
 and make login specific to each user type,  
with JWT auth and cookies.
backend/ folder with express server with REST API and serve static files from 
frontend/dist/public
frontend/dist/user
frontend/dist/adminLogin
frontend/dist/admin
folders in prod.

and a filter will check that user has proper auth to access user and admin folders. 
So non logged in user cannot even request the static files from those folders.
Some of the common css, js, images, etc will be in public folder and use by other 3.
frontend/dist/adminLogin is public but hopefully not well known.
The backend server will run on port 8434 in local and per passenger config in prod.
In local we will run vite seperately and server will have CORS.
The backend server will run on port 3000 in local.
The backend server will have endpoints for login, logout, and user/admin specific data.
Use express for backend with custom auth middleware.
public folder will not have a register page. Only a get an invite screen where user can enter year of birth, email and name.
Admin pages will have pages to list, disable, delete and create users.
User can create a public link (GET) or a public page (POST with captcha but no other auth) to share with their trusted contacts.
These pages will be random URLs of the form public/contact/<random-string> and will be stored in the database.
public/contact will be a seperate folder and a seperate SPA that will show a form to submit the contact info.
The public/contact SPA will use vue 3 and vite as well.
The backend will have endpoints to handle the public/contact form submissions.
